# Unreal Tournament (UT99) Android

> [!NOTE]
> **Fork pour la traduction française** de [Andiweli/UT99-Android](https://github.com/Andiweli/UT99-Android).
> - Le jeu passe en français quand l'app est en français (langue du téléphone, ou réglage de langue par app sous Android 13+).
> - Il utilise la traduction officielle (`.frt`) présente dans les données du jeu ; le moteur trouve aussi les fichiers en minuscules (`botpack.frt`…).
> - Les liens de téléchargement plus bas mènent aux versions officielles, sans ces changements.
>
> **Fork for the French translation** of [Andiweli/UT99-Android](https://github.com/Andiweli/UT99-Android).
> The game plays in French when the app's language is French (device language, or the per-app language setting on Android 13+),
> with the official French localization (`.frt`) of the game data; the engine also finds lower-case file names.
> The download links below lead to the upstream builds, without these changes.

> [!NOTE]
> Unofficial fan port.  
> No game data included.  
> Several bugs with triggers and events not starting 100%.  
> Requires legally obtained Unreal Tournament v1.400 game files.  
> This project is not official and is not endorsed by Epic Games.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Video games on smartphones are great, but not user-friendly if they require more than two thumbs to control. For this reason, this port is designed for controller input only and does only offer basic touchscreen controls.

## ▣ Requirements

- Android device with OpenGL ES 2.0 support.
- Android 4.1 / API 16 or newer.
- A compatible device.
- Android-compatible game controller recommended.
- Original Unreal Tournament / UT99 [PC game data v400](https://archive.org/download/ut-99_202512/UT99.iso).

Required game data folders:

```text
UnrealTournament/
├── System/
├── Maps/
├── Textures/
├── Sounds/
└── Music/
```

The installer accepts the folders either directly at the selected root or inside one top-level Unreal Tournament folder.

---

## ◎ Installation

1. Install the APK on your Android device.
2. Copy your Unreal Tournament game data to your device, either:
   - as an extracted folder, or
   - as a ZIP file.
3. Start **Unreal Tournament**.
4. If no game data is found, the installer screen appears.
5. Choose one of the following:
   - **Select UT99 folder**
   - **Select UT99 ZIP**
6. Wait until the import is finished.
7. The game starts automatically once the required data is found.

The app installs the game data into its private Android data folder.

## ◇ Default controller layout

The default controller mapping is designed for Android gamepads, OUYA and handheld devices such as Retroid-style controllers.

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| Left Stick | Move forward / backward / strafe |
| Right Stick | Look / turn |
| Left Trigger | Alternate Fire |
| Right Trigger | Fire |
| Left Shoulder | Previous Weapon |
| Right Shoulder | Next Weapon |
| A / right face button | Jump |
| B / bottom face button / OUYA O | Crouch |
| Y / left face button / OUYA U | Walk |
| X / top face button / OUYA Y | Wave |
| D-Pad | Menu navigation / in-game navigation depending on context |
| Start | Pause / menu |
| Back | Back / cancel depending on context |

> [!NOTE]
> Button names can differ between Android controllers.  
> If movement or looking feels wrong, open the in-game controls menu and reassign the affected controls.

## ▣ Game data notes

Game data is not bundled with this repository.

You need to provide your own legal copy of Unreal Tournament / UT99.  
The Android installer checks for the required folders:

```text
System
Maps
Textures
Sounds
Music
```

If these folders are missing, the game will not start and the installer screen will ask you to select a valid folder or ZIP file.
